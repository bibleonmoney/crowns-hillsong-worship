Hillsong Worship
There is a hill I cherish
Where stood a precious tree
The emblem of Salvation
The gift of Calvary
How is it I should profit?
While He is crucified
Yet as His life was taken
So I was granted mine
My wealth is in the cross
There's nothing more I want
Than just to know His love
My heart is set on Christ
And I will count all else as loss
The greatest of my crowns
Mean nothing to me now
For I counted up the cost
And all my wealth is in the cross
I will not boast in riches
I have no pride in gold
But I will boast in Jesus
And in His Name alone
My wealth is in the cross
There's nothing more I want
Than just to know His love
My heart is set on Christ
And I will count all else as loss
The greatest of my crowns
Mean nothing to me now
For I counted up the cost
And all my wealth is in the cross
Yes all my wealth is in the cross
And when I stand in glory
My crowns before the Lord
Let this be my confession
My wealth is in the cross (hallelujah)
My wealth is in the cross
There's nothing more I want
Than just to know His love
My heart is set on Christ
And I will count all else as loss
The greatest of my crowns
Mean nothing to me now
For I counted up the cost
And all my wealth is in the cross
There's nothing more I want
Than just to know His love
My heart is set on Christ
And I will count all else as loss
The greatest of my crowns
Mean nothing to me now
For I counted up the cost
And all my wealth is in the cross
Yes all my wealth is in the cross
My wealth is in the cross
Yes all my wealth is in the cross (hallelujah)
